Battery life is critical for most customers who are dissatisfied. Longer battery life is needed because customers want to wear the product continuously without charging. Also, it is needed to specify that it does not include a charger, because customers usually expect it to be included and are disappointed when they figure out it is not. Customers are mostly satisfied with its design, features, and quality. Especially, they love the diversity of rubber bands, so the product development and marketing team may use this information for future products and promotions.
