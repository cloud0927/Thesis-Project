Prioritize battery improvements: optimize power management for workouts and sleep, and expand low-power modes. Include a compatible charger/plug in the box or add unmistakable on-page packaging disclosures. Tighten QA to prevent missing components and DOA units. Offer clearer sizing guidance and a bundled small-wrist band option to improve fit confidence. Continue investing in health features (heart, sleep, safety) and simple, glanceable workout metrics. If feasible, refine radio design to strengthen cellular reception for edge cases without sacrificing battery. These product changes should reduce detractors and convert more passives into promoters.
