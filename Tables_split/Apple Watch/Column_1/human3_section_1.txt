the comments are mostly positive for the size and price, however, the negative comment all points out the same issue with the battery.Perfect size, good price, matches smoothly with iPhonelimited battery capacity, no charger attached to the product.customers are mostly satisfied with the new features compared to the last version, especially for the affordable price. However, the battery can be the biggest issue. The battery lasted for a short time and needed to be charged every day.
