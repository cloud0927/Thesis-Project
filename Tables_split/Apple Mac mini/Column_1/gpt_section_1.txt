Largely positive with many satisfied switchers and power users.Performance/speed, easy setup/UX, solid connectivity options.Base storage/upgrade pricing, limited ports for some setups, occasional monitor/Bluetooth quirks.Customers praise the Mac mini¡¯s speed and smoothness for creative and everyday tasks; frustrations concentrate on configuration limits and add-on costs rather than core performance.
