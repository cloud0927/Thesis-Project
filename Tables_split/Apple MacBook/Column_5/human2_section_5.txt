Overall, the product is highly satisfying. Customers mostly use the product to bring everywhere, so its lightweight and slim design is highly appreciated. Besides these positive features, the product development team may consider putting more ports for its enhanced connection with other devices. The design team may investigate its material to handle its fingerprint issues with specific color. Some customers reported minor quality issues regarding login and keyboard, it must be addressed by Quality Assurance team, and more detailed training for Customer Service team might be needed for better problem solving.
