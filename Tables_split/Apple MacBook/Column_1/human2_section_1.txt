Mostly satisfied with very few dissatisfaction.Portability with its lightweight, thin design, long battery life.Minor issues regarding its limited ports, login issues.Most customers are highly satisfied with the product, especially because of its portability. They use and bring it for work and study, so its great portability is highly appreciated.
