DesignFancy and cute design, nice size, and pretty color variance.It is too heavy and slides off with dynamic movements, such as running."They look sleek and feel high-end.", "I work out often and they do slide off my head.", "They look fantastic."Features and QualityGreat sound quality and noise cancelling. Smooth and well connectivity and compatibility with other products, especially Apple.Noise cancelling is not the best compared to competitors, call quality is bad, and sound leaks."The sound is spectacular and the integration with iPhone perfect.", "I love the sound proof on them and the sound itself sounds so smooth."Performance and BatteryBattery lasts long, Battery doesn't last long, It breaks so quickly, and the warranty is only 1 year, which is not enough.Customer comment: "I¡¯m over here charging these $500 headphones every week.", "I¡¯ve had them a year and yesterday they quit working.", "Stopped working just after the manufacturer warranty went out."
