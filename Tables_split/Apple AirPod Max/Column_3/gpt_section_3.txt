Audio qualityMany praise clear, rich sound with good detail and an engaging presentation.A minority describe sound as underwhelming or not meeting high expectations.Customer comments: ¡°Great sound,¡± ¡°quality is excellent,¡± while detractors mention ¡°overhyped¡± or ¡°not worth it¡± sonically.Noise cancellation & transparencyFrequently cited as strong and effective in masking background noise.Some report inconsistent results or issues when toggling ANC modes.Mentions of ¡°noise cancellation is great¡± appear often; a few note problems when enabling ANC or seeking better consistency.Connectivity & pairingWhen working, pairing and multi-device use feel seamless within the Apple ecosystem.Recurrent complaints of failed pairing, random disconnects, and needing hard resets; charging recognition also fails for some.¡°Had to hard reset,¡± ¡°won¡¯t pair/charge,¡± and ¡°stopped connecting after a while.¡±
