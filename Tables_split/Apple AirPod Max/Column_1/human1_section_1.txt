Positive and negative at the same time. Sound quality, Noise cancelling, Nice design.The High price is not worth it, it breaks too quickly, the warranty is only for 1 year, it is heavy, and slides off when moving.Around half of customers are satisfied with its quality and design, but other customers are dissatisfied, mostly because of its poor quality considering the price.
