The biggest problem is 'not worth the price'. Apple users mostly expect high quality with high price, but this product did not meet the expectation. Considering the brand image and reputation, it is suggested to improve the quality, rather than decrease the price. The priority is to expand the product's lifespan, make it lighter, and solve slide-off issues. Users wear the product when they are walking or running, so it is important to make it appropriate for moving. This topic should be considered in the product management and development team.
