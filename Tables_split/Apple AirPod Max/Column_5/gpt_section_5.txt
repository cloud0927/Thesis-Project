Prioritize reliability fixes: strengthen Bluetooth stack and handoff logic, add robust recovery without hard resets, and improve charging detection circuitry. Reduce weight and clamp force by revisiting headband tension and cup materials, and offer thicker/softer pads. Enhance ANC consistency via firmware tuning across modes. Add clearer on-device status/alerts for charge and connection. Finally, expand moisture ingress protection around drivers and connectors to mitigate long-term failures.
